                    <p>If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom (UK), ImpactX Bridge’s legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it. We may process your Personal Data because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We need to perform a contract with you (e.g., to provide our Service).</li>
                        <li>You have given us permission to do so.</li>
                        <li>The processing is in our legitimate interests and it's not overridden by your rights.</li>
                        <li>For payment processing purposes (if applicable in the future).</li>
                        <li>To comply with the law.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
                    <p>ImpactX Bridge will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
                    <p>Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.</p>


                    <h2>6. Transfer Of Data</h2>
                    <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction. Our primary operations are in India.</p>
                    <p>If you are located outside India and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to India and process it there.</p>
                    <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
                    <p>ImpactX Bridge will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.

                    <h2>7. Disclosure Of Data</h2>
                    <h3>Disclosure to Service Providers</h3>

                    <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
