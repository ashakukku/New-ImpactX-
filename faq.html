                        <p>Our pilot program is open to CSR teams from corporations looking to fund projects in Kerala, and grassroots NGOs operating in Kerala that meet our initial verification criteria. We are particularly interested in organizations focused on Healthcare, Education, Environment, and Livelihoods for this phase.</p>
